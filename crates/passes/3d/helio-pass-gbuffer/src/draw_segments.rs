//! Per-material draw segments (Helio#330, part 3).
//!
//! A draw pass needs one pipeline per `(material_class, graph_hash)` and a
//! CPU-side offset to draw from. The GPU range tables are current, but the CPU
//! only sees them through `helio-pass-object-batch`'s async readback, two or
//! more frames late. Drawing a late range table against current buffers draws
//! some groups with a neighbouring material's pipeline whenever the layout
//! shifts.
//!
//! Segments fix the offsets instead. `helio-pass-occlusion-cull` keeps a table
//! of every material key it has seen, each with a fixed region (`first`,
//! `capacity`) of [`DrawSegments::indirect`]. Range compaction appends each
//! range's surviving draws to its key's region and counts them in
//! [`DrawSegments::counts`], in the same frame. Passes draw each segment of
//! their bucket with its pipeline at its fixed offset, so the table only being
//! late means a key seen for the first time is skipped until it is added, never
//! drawn with the wrong pipeline. The table changes only when keys appear,
//! disappear or outgrow their region, so the recorded commands stay the same
//! frame to frame.
