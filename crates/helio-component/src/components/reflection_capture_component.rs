//! Reflection capture component (Phase D, Pulsar-Native#558): places a
//! parallax-corrected reflection probe influence volume in the scene.
//!
//! **Not rendered by this engine.** Deferred lighting samples a capture only
//! once a probe bake has assigned it a cubemap layer, and the engine runs no
//! probe baker, so a capture would never contribute. The component keeps
//! its authored settings, writes no scene rows and is reported unsupported
//! (Pulsar-Native#1035, Phase 4). `helio_pass_deferred_light::
//! ReflectionCaptureComponent` remains the only schema of the
//! `"reflection_captures"` buffer.
