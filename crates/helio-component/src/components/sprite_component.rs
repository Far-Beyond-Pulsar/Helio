//! A 2D sprite (Pulsar-Native #1060): an image or a tint drawn over the 3D
//! scene, as part of 2D rendering.
//!
//! Sprites are separate from every 3D pass. They live in a 2D screen space
//! of their own: 1 unit is 1 pixel, the origin is the centre of the view, Y
//! points up, and the 3D camera does not move them. The only notion of
//! depth is the `z_index`: among sprites, a higher one draws on top, and
//! every sprite draws over the 3D scene, after post-processing (the default
//! graphs' final 2D overlay, `helio_pass_sprite_batch`'s scene overlay).
//!
//! The owner's transform places the sprite: its X and Y are the sprite's 2D
//! position, its roll (rotation about Z) turns it and its X and Y scale
//! scale it; the owner's Z position and the other rotations do not apply.
//!
//! The image is a project-relative asset path, registered in the scene's
//! texture store as the row is derived (as decals do), so the row carries
//! its bindless slot. An image that is a sheet of equal frames (`atlas_columns`
//! by `atlas_rows`) shows the frame `atlas_frame`, counted row by row from
//! the top left.
//!
//! SceneDB derives a `SpriteSourceRow` (`environment_rows`) from the
//! authored value; the environment join places it as the sprite passes'
//! `helio_pass_sprite_batch::SpriteComponent` row in `"sprite_instances"`.
